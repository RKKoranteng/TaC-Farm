# Let's talk agile methodology
* **What's agile?** Agile methodology is an "adaptive" approach to project management because it prioritizes learning from previous outcomes and decisions to improve future practices.
* **What's the alternative to agile?** Waterfall methodology is the alternative to agile. Waterfall is a "predictive" approach to project management because it requires that the scope of the project are clearly defined and justified the detailed upfront planning. 
* **What problem(s) does agile solve?** The three most important challenges technology execs face (at least in my experience) are predictability, quality, and early return on investment. Below is a breakdown of how technology teams contribute to these business pain points. These become the reasons for agile.
  * not meeting commitments and product delivery timelines
  * putting poor quality products into market
  * more transparency and vsisibility between teams into what is going on with the product delivery
  * need to get products into market faster
  * finding ways to continuously improve processes
  * looking for better ways of incorporating customer feedback in real time

# Let's talk scrum framework
* **What's the scrum framework?** Scrum is a type of agile project management framework that helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices.
* **why is it called Scrum?** People often ask, "Is Scrum an acronym for something?" and the answer is no. It is actually inspired by a scrum in the sport of rugby. In rugby, the team comes together in what they call a scrum to work together to move the ball forward. In this context, Scrum is where the team comes together to move the product forward.
* **Is Scrum the only agile methodlogy?** No, scrum is not the only framework within agile methodology. Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), Lean Development, and  Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) are a few of the other types of frameworks within the agile methodology umbrella.
* **So why are we talking about scrum?** The scrum framework has gained popularity within IT industry because it allows teams to self-manage, learn from experience, and adapt to change. These become competitive advanges when a team is very product/software development focused. Scrum framework therefore fits perfectly as a project management method for technology projects and it helps teams address the challenges mentioned earlier.
