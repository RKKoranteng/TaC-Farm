# What is Agile methodology?
Agile methodology is a project management framework that breaks projects down into several dynamic phases, commonly known as "sprints". After every sprint, teams reflect and look back to see if there was anything that could be improved so they can adjust their strategy for the next sprint. This makes agile an iterative methodology because it allows teams to build, refine, and improve the project, product, or initiative. Unlike waterfall methodology (which isn't as effective for development teams), agile allows teams to work on smaller achievable tasks, then quickly gather feedback. This makes agile more effective because it allows for teams to build fast, learn fast, and adapt to any requirement changes.

## Sprint ceremonies
### What's a sprint ceremony?
The term "Sprint ceremony" comes from the concept of celebrating key milestones within the sprint. However, they're less about celebrations and more about establishing consistent checkpoints in a project’s lifecycle. These "ceremonies" are essentially meetings when the scrum master, product owner, and development team meet to plan work, discuss work in progress, gather feedback, and more. There are four main scrum ceremonies: 
1. the sprint planning meeting
1. the daily stand-up meeting
1. the sprint review meeting
1. the sprint retrospective meeting

### Sprint planning
* What: Sprint planning is when the team takes time to plan out what work will be completed during the upcoming sprint. These items are traditionally pulled from the product backlog, however they may also come up as new tasks.
* When: Spring planning occurs at the beginning of each spring.
* Who: Typically the sprint planning session has a bigger audience consisting of product owners, scrum master, and development team.
* Outcome: By the end of sprint planning everybody on the development team should know what the goal of the sprint (meaning what items are to be worked on and what items are placed in the baclkog for later).
* Time: Sprint planning sessions typically take 1 hour, however I've seen some take 4 hours (expecially in larger teams with more complex intiatives).

### Daily stand-up/scrum
* What: Daily stand-up is a daily meeting for the development team to update each other on their task progress (what they completed yesterday, what they're working on today, and if they have any blockers in their way).
* When: As the name implies, daily stand-up occurs once daily (typically in the morning before team members dive into their work).
* Who: Daily stand-up typically has a smaller audience than a sprint planning session. In most cases it consist of the scrum master and development team.
* Outcome: The intended goal here is for everyone on the development team to touch base with each other. If there're any blockers, then the Scrum master will get involved to help clear that.
* Time: Typically this is a quick status check that should only take 15-30 minutes.

### Sprint review


### Sprint retrospective
* What: Sprint retro is an opportunity for team members to reflect on the past sprint and think about what went well and what could be improved for next time.
* When: Sprint retro happens at the very end of a sprint, after a sprint review meeting. 
* Who: Sprint retro's consist of development team, Scrum master, or product owner. Anybody who actively worked on tasks throughout the sprint should attend this meeting.
* Outcome: The goal of this ceremony is to identify key points for iteration. If team members can find something to change and improve for the upcoming sprint, they should share that with the entire team. Agile methodology relies on continuous improvement, and retrospectives are an integral part of that process.
* Time: Sprint retro meetings are typically 1 hour.
