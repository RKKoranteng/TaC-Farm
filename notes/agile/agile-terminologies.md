# Let's talk agile methodology
* **What's agile?** Agile methodology is an "adaptive" approach to project management because it prioritizes learning from previous outcomes and decisions to improve future practices.
* **What's the alternative to agile?** Waterfall methodology is the alternative to agile. Waterfall is a "predictive" approach to project management because it requires that the scope of the project are clearly defined and justified the detailed upfront planning. 
* **What problem(s) does agile solve?** The three most important challenges technology execs face (at least in my experience) are predictability, quality, and early return on investment. Below is a breakdown of how technology teams contribute to these business pain points. These become the reasons for agile.
  * not meeting commitments and product delivery timelines
  * putting poor quality products into market
  * more transparency and vsisibility between teams into what is going on with the product delivery
  * need to get products into market faster
  * finding ways to continuously improve processes
  * looking for better ways of incorporating customer feedback in real time

* **Themes** are collection business goals/initiatives toward a common goal. This is the high-level view of (collection of epics).
* **Epics** are large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (called stories). The requirments of the epic are just too big to deliver in a single sprint.
* **Stories** also called "user stories" are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user along with the acceptance criteria for success. Think of user stories as individual features or requirements that the client (and business) wants. It is something that is deliverable (production ready) within a single sprint.
* **Tasks** are the actionable items (to-do list) that need to be completed inorder to achieve acceptance criteria of a user story. Think of the task as an element of a story, stepping stones to take the story to "Done". Tasks often follow the SMART acronym - specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-boxed.
