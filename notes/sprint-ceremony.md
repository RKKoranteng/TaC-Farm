# Sprint ceremonies
The term "Sprint ceremony" comes from the concept of celebrating key milestones within the sprint. However, they're less about celebrations and more about establishing consistent checkpoints in a project’s lifecycle. These "ceremonies" are essentially meetings when the scrum master, product owner, and development team meet to plan work, discuss work in progress, gather feedback, and more. There are four main scrum ceremonies: 
1. the sprint planning meeting
1. the daily stand-up meeting
1. the sprint review meeting
1. the sprint retrospective meeting

## 1. Sprint planning
* **What happens in this meeting?** Sprint planning is when the team takes time to plan out what work will be completed during the upcoming sprint. These items are traditionally pulled from the product backlog, however they may also come up as new tasks.
* **When does this ceremony happen?** Spring planning occurs at the beginning of each spring.
* **Who's involved?** Typically the sprint planning session has a bigger audience consisting of product owners, scrum master, and development team.
* **What is the expected outcome of this ceremony?** By the end of sprint planning everybody on the development team should know what the goal of the sprint (meaning what items are to be worked on and what items are placed in the baclkog for later).
* **How long does this ceremony take?** Sprint planning sessions typically take 1 hour, however I've seen some take 4 hours (expecially in larger teams with more complex intiatives).

## 2. Daily stand-up/scrum
* **What happens in this meeting?** Daily stand-up is a daily meeting for the development team to update each other on their task progress (what they completed yesterday, what they're working on today, and if they have any blockers in their way).
* **When does this ceremony happen?** As the name implies, daily stand-up occurs once daily (typically in the morning before team members dive into their work).
* **Who's involved?** Daily stand-up typically has a smaller audience than a sprint planning session. In most cases it consist of the scrum master and development team.
* **What is the expected outcome of this ceremony?** The intended goal here is for everyone on the development team to touch base with each other. If there're any blockers, then the Scrum master will get involved to help clear that.
* **How long does this ceremony take?** Typically this is a quick status check that should only take 15-30 minutes.

## 3. Sprint review
* **What happens in this meeting?** Sprint review is an opportunity for the development team to receive feedback from key stakeholders of a project. The goal of this meeting is to receive feedback on the work the development team completed during this sprint. The Scrum master organizes the meeting, showcases the team’s completed work, and facilitates questions from external stakeholders who are not on the development team.
* **When does this ceremony happen?** Sprint review happens at the end of the sprint when all tasks are completed, but before the sprint retrospective occurs. 
* **Who's involved?** The development team, Scrum master, and product owner are all required to attend this meeting.
* **What is the expected outcome of this ceremony?** This meeting is an opportunity for both stakeholders to give feedback and ask questions about the end product. The Scrum master may use this opportunity to work with stakeholders to figure out if the product backlog needs adjustment.
* **How long does this ceremony take?** Similar to sprint planning, this meeting should last about an hour. However, I've also seen Sprint review sessions that last up to 4 hours.

## 4. Sprint retrospective
* **What happens in this meeting?** Sprint retro is an opportunity for team members to reflect on the past sprint and think about what went well and what could be improved for next time.
* **When does this ceremony happen?** Sprint retro happens at the very end of a sprint, after a sprint review meeting. 
* **Who's involved?** Sprint retro's consist of development team, Scrum master, or product owner. Anybody who actively worked on tasks throughout the sprint should attend this meeting.
* **What is the expected outcome of this ceremony?** The goal of this ceremony is to identify key points for iteration. If team members can find something to change and improve for the upcoming sprint, they should share that with the entire team. Agile methodology relies on continuous improvement, and retrospectives are an integral part of that process.
* **How long does this ceremony take?** Sprint retro meetings are typically 1 hour.

## Bonus: Backlog refinement
Backlog ~~grooming~~ refinement is about creating shared understanding on what the product will and won’t do, as well as the effort it will take to implement it. Backlog refinement used to be called backlog grooming, however the name changed because grooming became a dirty word that is not tolarted by most companies. Backlog refinement is an ongoing activity typically held once during the sprint. Think of this meeting as a session for teams to identify work and estimate as a group. Some teams treat backlog refinement as its own ceremnoy, while other buil it into their sprint planning; it all boils down to if your team can afford a longer sprint planning session.
