## About this project
Hi, welcome to the Modern DBA project on GitHub. My name is [Richard Koranteng](https://rkkoranteng.com) and I started this project as way to share my knowldge and experience for FREE. This project is intended for database administrators that are looking to upskill and stay relevant in the tech workforce. The project is broken into theory (notes) and hands-on (assignments). At the end of this project, you should be able to:
* understand and speak DevOps terminilogies
* use popular CI/CD tools for automation
* identify how to modernize database environments

Here're some tips for your success:
* dedicate at least 4 hours weekly towards notes + assignments
* collab with others on our [Discord channel](#)

Ok, good luck as your learn how to become a modern DBA.
